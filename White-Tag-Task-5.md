## Task 5 - More Advancd Simulation - The Game of Plinko

Now let's simulate a more complex physical system.  Then we can take the basic ideas and create the start of a simple game.

### Bouncing Ball
We can use the VPython library and a little bit of physics to simulate the motion of a ball bouncing off a floor.  We will complete what amounts to a 1-dimentional simulation, but notice the code you develop can be used for 2- and 3-dimentional simulations with only a few modifications.

First, we need to lay out the basic physics we will use.  First, an object falling on Earth obeys the simple Newtonian physics of $F = ma$ with $F = mg$ and $g = 9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$


- [ ] Task 5_2 - Basic Plinko - Plinko is a basic game where the player drops a ball that bounces off a set of pins and then lands at the bottom in a bin.  Each bin has some number of points.  The points are based on the probability the ball will land in the bin [Plinko] (https://priceisright.fandom.com/wiki/Plinko).  Use the template code *Task_5_2_Plinko.py* to create the start of a basic Plinko game.  Push your code for feedback and completion of task 5_2.
