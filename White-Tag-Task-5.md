## Task 5 - Putting it all together

Let's use physics and code to model and simulate a bouncing ball.

We know from basic physics that an object in a gravitational field will obey the following equations for verticle position and velocity:

$$ r_1 = r_0 + v \cdot \delta t $$

$$ v_1 = v_0 + a \cdot \delta t $$
