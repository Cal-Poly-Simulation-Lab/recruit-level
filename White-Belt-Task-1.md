# PolySim Recruit Level Task List
The Cal Poly Simulation Lab (PolySim) is dedicated to working on projects involving modeling and simulation of aerospace systems.  Two of our primary objective are to support club members as they develop their own modeling and simulation skills.  Through the **PolySim Belt Program**, club members will start learning the basic tools of modeling and simulation, including writing code and building hardware.

After completing the tasks in this assignment, you will advance to the PolySim **Recruit Level** and your Cal Poly Simulaiton Lab **White Belt**.

To impliment almost all modeling and simulation projects, you will need to use some code.  At the white belt level, you will learn the basics of programming using the Python programming language.  Python is a widely used, easy to learn, multipurpose programming language.  As with any langauge, there is always more to learn, and what you learn about Python can be applied to many other langagues.  Learning one Python will help you pick up and use other languages in your PolySim Blet journey.

In this activity, you will:
- Learn some basic python techniques such as:
  - Basic syntax or format
  - Using Python as a calculator
  - Logic and flow control to perform more complicated algorithms
  - Working with different data types
- Learn basic MatplotLib techniques to display static data
- Learn basic VPython commands to create visualizations of dynamic data
- Put all of these skills together to model and simulate the dynamics of a physical system

Keep in mind there are many existing tutorials on line.  Some good, some not.  This Repo/Classroom is a PolySim specific place to assit PolySim members in their modeling and simulation journey.  These are resources we have found useful (and free).  But, if you find other resources, please use them and share with other PolySim memebrs.  Modeling and Simulation (especially coding) is a fast moving place to be and we are always looking to grow as individuals and as a club.

## Task 1 - Learn the Basics of Python
There are many coding langagues out there and through your PolySim belt journey, you will have the opportunity to learn several of them.  We will start with **Python**.  For more backgroun on Python check out their website, [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).  And of corse, we love Wikipedia [Python (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

Python is a general purpose, object-oriented, procedural/functional, structured, and reflective language that has become very popular since is was concieved in the late 1980s.  But the real impact of Python came in the late 2000s with the release of Python 2.7 and again with the release of Python 3.0.  These days, we will be using Python 3.11 or higher.  But, the basics of Python have not changed significantly over that time.

### Task 1.1 - Download and Install Python
The first thing you need to do is download and install Python.  Fortunatly this is about the easiest thing to do.  Follow this link and install the version of Python appropriate to your Operating System or OS [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Task 1.2 - The Basics of Python
Once you have Python installed, it is time to start working through a basic tutorial.  Instead of reinventing the *Python Tutorial Wheel* were going to use an existing tutorial from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).  To be sure, there are other tutorials out these, but this one is free and easy to use, so that's why we recommend it.  But, don't be afraid to explore what's out there.

To complete Task 1.2, work through the sections **Python HOME** to **Python Operators**.  To show you have completed Task 1.2, attached a screen shot of the completed excercises to this file.

For example, in this screen shot, I have completed two tutorials (PYTHON Syntax and PYTHON Comments).

### Task 1.3 - Python Data Collections
The basic data types explored in Task 1.2 are common to most coding languages and used frequently.  But, many times, we want to store collections of data.  In Python, we use **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries** in these cases.  As you learn more about coding and the general ideas of modeling and simulation, the value of storing data in collections will become more obvious.

To complete Task 1.3, work through the sections **Python Lists** to **Python Dictionaries**.  To show you have completed Task 1.3, attached a screen shot of the completed excercises to this file.

### Task 1.4 - Flow Control and Functions
So far we have learned the basics of using Python as a calculator at the *command line*.  But what if we want to perfrom more complicated algorithms, or at a minimum, apply the same calculation to a collection data type like a list?  This is where flow control comes in.  Python (like most languages) uses the *if...else*, *while*, and *for* constructs to control *program execution*.  Another very important way to execuit code is by using **functions**.  In fact, many of the built-in Python commands are functions themselves.

To complete Task 1.4, work through the sections **Python If...Else** to **Python Functions**.  To show you have completed Task 1.4, attached a screen shot of the completed excercises to this file.

**Congratulations!  You have completed Task 1!**
