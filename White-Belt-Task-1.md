# Task 1 - Learn the Basics of Python
There are many coding langagues out there and through your PolySim belt journey, you will have the opportunity to learn several of them.  We will start with **Python**.  For more backgroun on Python check out their website, [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).  And of corse, we love Wikipedia [Python (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

Python is a general purpose, object-oriented, procedural/functional, structured, and reflective language that has become very popular since is was concieved in the late 1980s.  But the real impact of Python came in the late 2000s with the release of Python 2.7 and again with the release of Python 3.0.  These days, we will be using Python 3.11 or higher.  But, the basics of Python have not changed significantly over that time.

## General Information for Completing this Level
In the PolySim Belt Program, we will used the GitHub Classroom for many of the tasks.  To complete these tasks, you will need to accept the assignment.  Once you do, you can open VS Code and clone the new assignment repository.  You will be asked to make changes to various parts of code, test the code in the VS Code Unit Test framework, and then *commit* and *synch* your code back to the repository.  If all unit tests pass, and upon review of the PolyView Belt Coordinator, you will receive your tag.

Each bit of code you write/modify will be contained within a *function*.  You will learn more about functions later, but in the mean time, all your code will be surrounded by a function definition like:

```
def my_function():
   #your code here
```

This will make the unit testing easier and clear.

## Task 1.1 - Download and Install Python
The first thing you need to do is download and install Python.  Fortunatly this is about the easiest thing to do.  Follow this link and install the version of Python appropriate to your Operating System or OS [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Task 1.2 - The Basics of Python
Once you have Python installed, it is time to start working through a basic tutorial.  Instead of reinventing the *Python Tutorial Wheel* were going to use an existing tutorial from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).  To be sure, there are other tutorials out these, but this one is free and easy to use, so that's why we recommend it.  But, don't be afraid to explore what's out there.

To complete Task 1.2, work through the sections **Python HOME** to **Python Operators**.  Once you have completed the tutorial, complete the Python code in your repo and push your changes for grading once your code passes all tests.  You will modify the file called, *Task_1_code.py*.

## Task 1.3 - Python Data Collections
The basic data types explored in Task 1.2 are common to most coding languages and used frequently.  But, many times, we want to store collections of data.  In Python, we use **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries** in these cases.  As you learn more about coding and the general ideas of modeling and simulation, the value of storing data in collections will become more obvious.

To complete Task 1.3, work through the sections **Python Lists** to **Python Dictionaries**.  To show you have completed Task 1.3, continue modifying the file *Task_1_code.py*, and synch your changes for scoring.

## Task 1.4 - Flow Control and Functions
So far we have learned the basics of using Python as a calculator at the *command line*.  But what if we want to perfrom more complicated algorithms, or at a minimum, apply the same calculation to a collection data type like a list?  This is where flow control comes in.  Python (like most languages) uses the *if...else*, *while*, and *for* constructs to control *program execution*.  Another very important way to execuit code is by using **functions**.  In fact, many of the built-in Python commands are functions themselves.

To complete Task 1.4, work through the sections **Python If...Else** to **Python Functions**.  To show you have completed Task 1.3, continue modifying the file *Task_1_code.py*, and synch your changes for scoring.

**Congratulations!  You have completed Task 1!**
