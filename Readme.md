# PolySim Recruit Level - Basics of Python and Simulation
The Cal Poly Simulation Laboratory (PolySim) is dedicated to working on projects involving modeling and simulation of aerospace systems.  One of our primary objectives is to support club members as they develop their own modeling, simulation, and controls skills.  Through the **PolySim Tag Program**, club members will start learning the basic tools of modeling and simulation, including writing code and building hardware.

After completing the tasks in this **assignment**, you will advance to the PolySim **Recruit** level and earn your Cal Poly Simulaiton Lab **White Tag**.

## Recruit Level Overview
To impliment almost all modeling and simulation projects, you will need to use some code.  At the white tag level, you will learn the basics of programming using the Python programming language.  Python is a widely used, easy to learn, multipurpose programming language.  As with any langauge, there is always more to learn, and what you learn about Python can be applied to many other langagues.  Learning Python will help you pick up and use other languages in your **PolySim Tag Program** journey.

## Recruit Level Task List
To earn the White Tag, you will complete the following tasks:
- [ ] Task 0: Learn the basics of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Task 1: Learn some basic Python techniques such as:
  - Basic syntax, format, and variables
  - Logic and flow control to perform more complicated algorithms
  - Working with different data types
  - Basics of algorithms and functions
- [ ] Task 2: Explore the difference between different types of varialbe/data
- [ ] Task 3: Learn basic MatplotLib techniques to display static data
- [ ] Task 4: Learn basic VPython commands to create visualizations of dynamic data
- [ ] Task 5: Put all of these skills together to model and simulate the dynamics of a bouncing ball and the start of a plinko game

Keep in mind there are many existing tutorials on line.  Some good, some not.  This *Repo/Classroom* is a PolySim specific place to assit PolySim members in their modeling and simulation journey.  These are resources we have found useful (and free).  But, if you find other resources, please use them and share with other PolySim memebrs.  Modeling and Simulation (especially coding) is a fast moving place to be and we are always looking to grow our skills as individuals and as a club.
