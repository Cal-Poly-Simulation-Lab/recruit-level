## Task 3 - Learn the Basics of Matploylib

Python uses modules to extend the capability of the langauge and to manage code that is reused.  You can create your own module, but we are going to start by installing a popular module and *import* that module into our code for our own use.  The modules we are going to use in this task are [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/) and [*numpy*](https://numpy.org/).

### Task 3.1 - Install Matplotlib
Installing additional modules is easy using VS Code and most integrated development environments (IDEs).
- [ ] In the terminal, use *pip* to install *Matplotlib* using the command `pip install matplotlib`
- [ ] Now, let's write some code to plot something.  Open the template Python code, *matplotlib_test.py*

### Task 3.2 - Basic Plot
- [ ] Now, let's write some code to plot something.  Open the template Python code, *matplotlib_test.py*.
- [ ] Fix the code so that the data is plotted and displayed in a new window.
- [ ] Submit your updated code by pushing your changes.

Obviously these is a lot more we can do with Matplotlib and Numpy (see the websites for more) but these are the basics.

Your plot should look like this:
