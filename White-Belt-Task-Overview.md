# PolySim Recruit Level Task List
The Cal Poly Simulation Lab (PolySim) is dedicated to working on projects involving modeling and simulation of aerospace systems.  Two of our primary objective are to support club members as they develop their own modeling and simulation skills.  Through the **PolySim Belt Program**, club members will start learning the basic tools of modeling and simulation, including writing code and building hardware.

After completing the tasks in this assignment, you will advance to the PolySim **Recruit Level** and your Cal Poly Simulaiton Lab **White Belt**.

To impliment almost all modeling and simulation projects, you will need to use some code.  At the white belt level, you will learn the basics of programming using the Python programming language.  Python is a widely used, easy to learn, multipurpose programming language.  As with any langauge, there is always more to learn, and what you learn about Python can be applied to many other langagues.  Learning one Python will help you pick up and use other languages in your PolySim Blet journey.

In this activity, you will:
- Learn some basic python techniques such as:
  - Basic syntax or format
  - Using Python as a calculator
  - Logic and flow control to perform more complicated algorithms
  - Working with different data types
- Learn basic MatplotLib techniques to display static data
- Learn basic VPython commands to create visualizations of dynamic data
- Put all of these skills together to model and simulate the dynamics of a physical system

Keep in mind there are many existing tutorials on line.  Some good, some not.  This Repo/Classroom is a PolySim specific place to assit PolySim members in their modeling and simulation journey.  These are resources we have found useful (and free).  But, if you find other resources, please use them and share with other PolySim memebrs.  Modeling and Simulation (especially coding) is a fast moving place to be and we are always looking to grow as individuals and as a club.
