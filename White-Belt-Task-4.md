## Task 4 - Basic 3D visulaization with VPython

[VPython](https://vpython.org/) is a simple to use 3D visulaization module with a simple Python interface.  Again, there are many tools/libraries out there to plot and visualize data and simulation, but we will start with VPython.  Three dimensional animation or visualization is often a key element of modeling and simulation.  Once you build a model and simulate the system, you often want to **see** what happened.  Hence, visualization or animation.  Fortunately there is a strong overlap between the modeling and simulation world and the computer video game world.
